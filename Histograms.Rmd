This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)

data <- c(rep(15, times = 5), rep(25, times = 3), rep(4, times = 10), rep (7, times = 3))
hist(data, prob = TRUE)
lines(density(data), col = "red")


dataset <- data.frame(data)
g <- ggplot(dataset, aes(x = data)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..)) + geom_density()
g


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
